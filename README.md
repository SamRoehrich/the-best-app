# Not another mapping app

Linear for Athletes.

Athletes are a tough bunch to work with. They are pretty much all type-A.
They annoy everyone. They only care about themselves, their PR's, their calories,
watts... They are insufferable.
As the saying goes "misery loves company" and athletes love nothing more than
to compare the days workouts to their competitor. 
This is the best app in the world at viewing, sharing and talking about your 
sport.

We aim to take the social aspect of Strava and the data aspect of TrainingPeaks
and give you the best experience possible to connect with your friends, track 
your progress and podium your next race.

## What makes us different

Strava is VC backed its going to enshitify its product with the next hyped up 
feature no one wants until there is no one left. 
Training Peaks will never embrace social, its not their business.

With teams and groups we take a community based approach to endurance sports
because we believe these sports are best done with others not alone so we
built a platform that encourages that. I know you all want to compete, and you
can and should. Competing against your peers is better than competing against 
yourself.
